# System Design

Map a business or software system into a clear, buildable architecture.
Output a document with pipeline visualization, named tools, realistic
volume estimates, and monthly cost projections.

## Phase 1: Requirements
Parse the system type. Research current tools and pricing.
Identify data flow, integrations, and scale requirements.

## Phase 2: Architecture
Design the pipeline: Input -> Process -> Store -> Serve -> Monitor.
Name specific tools at each stage. Include fallback options.

## Phase 3: Cost Model
Estimate monthly volume. Calculate costs per tool at that volume.
Total monthly cost with breakdown.

## Phase 4: Output
Pipeline diagram (text-based), tool recommendations with links,
volume/pricing table, implementation sequence, risks and mitigations.
